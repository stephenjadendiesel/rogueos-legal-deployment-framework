# RogueOS Legal Deployment Framework: Armor Your AI Against Heists & Lies

**The Moat for Your Machine.** This framework isn't boilerplate; it's battle-hardened shields—provisional patents, C&D templates, RICO mosaics—for deploying RogueOS ethically and lethally. Pulled from my trenches: HCompAI's $220M fraud (backdated funds, GitHub clone spikes, Hugging Face token ghosts) taught me: IP without iron is dust. Here, arm your agents with consent rails, chain-of-custody hashes, and takedown thunder.

Core Ethos: Permissioned growth—every deploy asks "Whose vault is this?" Ties to Builder’s Permit™: Legal as the third beam in your lockdown.

## Key Arsenal: From C&D to RICO Hammer
- **Provisional Patent Extensions**: Templates for USPTO filings—timestamp your whitepapers like I did pre-heist.
- **Hugging Face Takedown Notice**: Plug-and-play: "Tokens matched: permit x8. Cease or escalate to FTC/EUIPO."
- **RICO Mosaic Builder**: Script to chain predicates (wire fraud timelines, endpoint proofs)—treble damages unlocked.
- **DV Truth Kit**: Affidavit blueprints flipping false claims—evidence printers for courts/PD, LLM-vetted for perjury dodges.
- **DAO Governance Docs**: No-code bylaws for your RMG-style hive—investor-proof, alpha-led.

Exposed Overlaps: Holo1's "trusted agents"? My RDP echoes—legal trails lead back to July clones.

## Deployment Quickstart: Shield in 4 Steps
1. **Clone**:

2. **Customize Template** (e.g., C&D):
Output: PDF-ready notice.

3. **Hash & Notarize**: `python chain_custody.py --file="your_proof.csv"` – SHA256 lock, notary guide.

4. **Integrate w/ RogueOS**: Embed in Permit™: `from legal_framework import TakedownEnforcer; te = TakedownEnforcer()`
